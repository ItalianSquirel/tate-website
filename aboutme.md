## About Me
I am a college student studying Computer Engineering at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and working on various projects. Currently, I'm exploring Linux and experimenting with its capabilities. I have experience working on a range of projects, some of which are practical while others are more experimental. I possess skills in Python, Windows Command-line Tools, Node-Red, and even 3-D Modeling. I am proficient in operating systems like OSX, Windows, and various Linux distributions.

My background in high school debate has honed my ability to write clearly, engage readers, and deliver impactful content. While I may occasionally make a typo, I excel at tasks like writing grants, documentation, and other writing projects.
